# Ralph's Vue Demo

## Project description

This is a simple Vue.js app created with the [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) tool. The index page contains an input box where the user can type some text
which will automatically be displayed in upper case in the box below.

A live version of the app hosted with Heroku can be visited [here](https://salty-beyond-43499.herokuapp.com/)

### Running locally

In order to run the app locally the following steps must be taken

- `git clone` the repository into a directory
- Navigate into the directory and run `npm install` if using npm or `yarn install` if using yarn
- Once installation of all necessary dependencies has been completed, run `npm run serve` if using npm or `yarn serve` if using yarn

In the output of the terminal where the `serve` command was executed will be a link to the app which can be navigated to in your browser.
